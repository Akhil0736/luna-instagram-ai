# Architecture

Document the overall Luna system design here:

- High-level diagrams for data flow between `frontend/`, `riona/`, and `openmanus/`.
- Key components and responsibilities.
- Technology choices and rationale.
- Deployment topology and environments.

Consider using the `docs/blueprint.md` in `frontend/docs/` as a starting point if relevant.
