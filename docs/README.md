# Luna Documentation

Centralized documentation for the Luna project spanning architecture, setup, and API references.

## Structure

- `architecture/` — System diagrams, design decisions, and module overviews.
- `setup-guides/` — Environment setup, local dev, and deployment guides.
- `api/` — API references (REST, GraphQL, SDKs) and schemas.

Contributions welcome. Keep docs up to date alongside code changes.
